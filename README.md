### Problem Domain
When you receive an email from usps that you package has been delivered, Tenants are unsure if the package has been delivered to the apartment office or not. 
So using our app, building managers can scan the qr code in the package which will automatic send the email and text to the tenant that their package is in the office for pickup. Tenants are assured that
their package has been delivered and is safe stored in office.
